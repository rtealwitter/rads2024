\section*{Problem 1: Normal Distribution from Darts}

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics{graphics/dartboard.jpeg}
	\caption{A dartboard. Intuitively, the likelihood that a dart hits a particular point should only depend on the distance to the center and rotating the dartboard shouldn't change where darts likely land.}
\end{figure}

In this problem, we will derive the density function of the normal distribution from the example of a dartboard.
Let $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to [0,1]$ be a probability density function that describes the probability a dart lands at the point $(x,y)$.
We want our probability density function $f$ to have two properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Radial symmetry:} The probability that a dart lands at a point depends only on the distance between the point and the origin.
    \item \textbf{Independence:} Coordinates are independent e.g., knowing the $x$-coordinate does not give us information about the $y$-coordinate.
\end{enumerate}

From the radial symmetry property, we can conclude that
\begin{align}\label{eq:radial_symmetry}
f(x,y) = f(r) = f(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})
\end{align}
where $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ is the distance between the origin and $(x,y)$.

From the independence property, we can conclude that $f(x,y) = g(x) h(y)$ for some functions $g$ and $h$.
Further, the radial symmetry property tells us that $f(x,y) = f(y,x) = g(y) h(x)$ so $g$ and $h$ must be the same function.
That is,
\begin{align}\label{eq:independence}
f(x,y) = g(x) g(y).
\end{align}

\subsection*{Part 1 (.5 points)} 

Up to rescaling, we can assume that $g(0)=1$.
Use this fact and plug in the point $(r,0)$ to conclude that $f$ and $g$ are the same function.

\subsection*{Part 2 (.5 points)}

Define the function $h(x) = f(\sqrt{x})$.
In particular,
\begin{align}\label{eq:define_h}
f(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}) = f(x) f(y) \Leftrightarrow
h(x^2 + y^2) = h(x^2) + h(y^2).
\end{align}
Use this property to show that
\begin{align}\label{eq:h_linear}
h(x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n) = h(x_1) + h(x_2) + \ldots + h(x_n).
\end{align}
Then prove that $h(n) = h(1)^n$.

Without loss of generality, let $h(1) = b$.

\subsection*{Part 3 (1 point)}

Let $p$ and $q$ be any integers.
Prove that 
\begin{align}\label{eq:to_prove}
h\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = b^{\frac{p}{q}}.
\end{align}

\textbf{Hint:} Consider the expression
\begin{align*}
h\left(\frac{p}{q} \cdot q \right).
\end{align*}

As long as $h$ is continuous, conclude that $h(x) = b^x$ for any real number since the rational numbers are dense in the real number line.

\subsection*{Part 4 (1 point)}

You have shown that $h(x) = b^x$. Further, $h(x) = e^{cx}$ for some real number $c$.
Then $f(x) = h(x^2) = e^{c x^2}$.
Recall this implies the density function of $x$ and $y$ is $f(x,y) = f(x) f(y) = e^{c (x^2 + y^2)}$.

For $f$ to be a valid probability density function, what constraint do we have on $c$?
If we wanted to make the distribution more concentrated, how should we change $c$?

Except for the normalization, we have explained every part of the multivariate normal distribution given below
\begin{align*}
f(x,y) = \frac1{\sigma \cdot 2 \pi} \exp\left(-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\sigma^2}\right).
\end{align*}
Why is there a normalization?
